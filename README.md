<H1>1 Heuristics</H1>
<H2>1 Cristofides algorithm</H2>
This algorithm works in 6 steps: <br/>  

1. Create a minimal spaning tree for all the nodes. <br/>

2. Isolate nodes with a odd amount of connections
3. Connect all nodes in pairs and find a minimum length for the connections. <br/>

4. Combine the connections from step 1 and 3 into a multigraph. (this means that some nodes can have multiple connections to the same node) <br/>

5. Generate Eulerian tour of the multigraph
6. Generate TSP from Eulerian tour (follow the Euleriantour and if you reach a already visited node skip it) <br/>

<H2>1 Greedy heuristic</H2>
//todo <br/>

<H1>2 Optimizations</H1>
Once a path is generated by a heuristic there are a lot of ways to make improvements to it. This way we can get closer to optimal solution and try to decreade the total distance even further.
<H2>1 random swapping</H2>
This method works by getting 2 random points in the path and changing the order they are visited. This has a small chance of improving the total distance but it can run very fast so it has a lot of opertunities to find a better path. <br/>

 ![randomswap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a94ba6d-5094-4e5e-830d-8acde30c370a)

This method does have a high probability of ending in a local peak where it cant improve anymore by only swapping 2 points but hasn't found the actual optimal solution.
<H2>2 2-opt improvement</H2>
In 2-opt improvement 2 edges are selected and have their end points swaped. To be sure this leads to a valid route the edges can't be attatched to each other. There are always 2 other ways to connect these edges but only one of them will still lead to a valid tour which connects all nodes. This new tour will then have its lenght compaired to the old tour and the shortest tour will be chosen to iterate futher on. <br/>

In my testing this resulted into a better rusult with more points as the random swap method but still has a chanche of falling into a local minimum. <br/>
